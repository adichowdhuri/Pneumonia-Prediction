# Pneumonia-Prediction
This model uses Chest X-Rays to predict if someone has pneumonia or not\
We use CNN to classify images into two classes = ['NORMAL', 'PNEUMONIA']\
The model accuracy here is low due to large dataset size and long training times.\
The model accuracy can be imporved by improvising on the Model
